### Make the command line work for you (in Windows)
*Notes from my NICAR15 class*

#####How it works
When youâ€™re in the command line, you are always in a particular place on your computer.  You usually start in your home directory, at `C:\Users\\*user*`. On my computer, that's: 

\> C:\Users\eklucas

To move around, you use the **`cd`** command (change directory)

\> cd Desktop

\> C:\Users\eklucas\Desktop
