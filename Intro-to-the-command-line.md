Before walking through this exercise, download the Salaries.csv and put it into a folder called "Exercise" on your Desktop. You can call it something else, but just remember to swap out "Exercise" for your folder name in the following commands. 

####Getting Started
When youâ€™re in the command line, you are always in a particular place on your computer.  You usually start in your home directory, at `C:\Users\\*user*`. On my computer, that's: 

C:\Users\eklucas \>

To move around, you use the **`cd`** command (change directory)

C:\Users\you \> cd Desktop

C:\Users\you\Desktop \>

Another useful command
