###_What is Geocoding?_
Most of us have gotten data at one point or another that includes addresses; small business loans, lottery ticket winners, school test scores, and parking tickets are just a few examples of data that almost always include an address. Less often we get fields labeled "latitude" and "longitude."

In order to put addresses on a map, any mapping software needs those lat and long coordinates. When you enter an address into Google Maps, it quickly calculates the coordinates for that address and plots it on the map: that's *_geocoding_*.

Unfortunately, as reporters dealing with 1 million records (or even 100 records), entering addresses into a map one at a time isn't an option. THankfully there are geocoding services out there that will geocode hundreds or thousands of addresses very quickly, and plenty will do it for free. These geocoding services take our data, geocode the addresses and tack on latitude and longitude to the end of our data file. From there we can load the data into a mapping program and map away!
